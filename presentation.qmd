## Introduction {.smaller background-image="/dbd-gallery-background.jpg"}

Data manually collected from my own matches in the online game 'Dead by Daylight' over the year 2021. [Raw CSV file](https://github.com/doubavitch/Dead-by-Daylight-Data-Visualization/blob/main/Dead%20by%20Daylight%20data.csv)

How the game works:

-   1 killer, 4 survivors
-   Killer: Injure, hook and eventually kill as many survivors as possible
-   Survivors: Repair generators and try to open the exit gates and escape (only after 5 generators were repaired)
